### Greetings, traveler!

Welcome to my ~~myspace~~ ~~facebook~~ ~~portfolio~~ attic of things I am or was interested in. Many of these repositories are straight-up forks, only some contain actual modifications. The ones that actually have some content are:

* [PytorchWCT](https://github.com/black-puppydog/PytorchWCT/), a modified implementation of the really cool WCT stylization algorithm, which I needed for my PhD thesis. The code is dormant and targets pytorch 1.0, so you have been warned but it contains the models files and everything else you need to run it.
* [node-emoji-rs](https://github.com/black-puppydog/node-emoji-rs) is a modified fork of [gh-emoji](https://github.com/kornelski/gh-emoji) which adds a ton more emoji shortcodes from the [emoji-data](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data) repo. You can find this on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/node-emoji) and just `cargo add` it.
* [qBittorrent-untracked](https://github.com/black-puppydog/qbittorrent-untracked) is a simple helper I use to keep my dataset torrents in sync with reality. I thought it was just about complicated enough to make this and it might save someone a few minutes.

Besides that, my [gitlab](gitlab.com/dwynen) has some forks and coursework and other stuff as well.

I mostly hang out on [SSB](https://scuttlebutt.nz) which is organized in the [SSBC](https://github.com/ssbc/) org, as well as various other places on github and gitlab. My main identity there is `@MRiJ+CvDnD9ZjqunY1oy6tsk0IdbMDC4Q3tTC8riS3s=.ed25519` and you can find all the others from that profile.

I'm also [@mmcm@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@mmcm) if you're into that. Here are some keywords to give you an idea of what I'm currently interested in, in arbitrary order:

AI, Rust, Speech Recognition, Diarization, Computer Vision, Decentralization, Politics, Security, Cryptography, Python, Myco
